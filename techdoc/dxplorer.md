To allow users to access dxplorer.net in "premium mode", a URL is generated by the config program. Among other things, this URL contains a "key" parameter which is generated using:

* the current callsign
* some authentication data stored in the EEPROM of the WSPRlite
* a counter indicating how many time the callsign has been changed (also stored in the EEPROM)

This key is intended only to prove that someone who wishes to use that callsign has access to a real WSPRlite.

Source code for generating a key value is in **src/common/dxplorer.cpp** (DXplorer::generateKey).

The config program itself does not currently access the network. No data about you or your WSPRlite is shared, unless you visit the generated URL.

If you visit the generated URL, it is logged by dxplorer.net to ensure that only the most recent callsign programmed into that WSPRlite has access to premium mode. The data present in the URL is mostly plain text (so that you know what information you are sharing), except for the key which is described above.
